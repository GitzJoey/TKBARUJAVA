                        Plugins allow you to extend the basic functionality of your charts. You can develop your own
                        plugins or use plugins that others have already developed.

                        Once you have included a plugin in your project you can use it in your chart by specifying it explicitly
                        in the plugins section of your chart configuration. Check the <a href="#available-plugins">List of plugins</a>
                        section to see what plugins you can use.

                        Plugins are chainable and the order of specification in the plugins array of your configuration
                        is important for the end result.

                        Chartist.js expects an array of plugin functions to be present in the <code>plugins</code> array
                        of the chart configuration. Usually plugins should be written as function factories so you
                        can pass additional parameters and options to the factory which is creating the plugin function and returns it.

                  Here you can find a list of known plugins. Usually plugins should be available from both Bower and NPM for
                  installation. If you have developed your own plugin but can't find it here, you should create a
                  <a href="https://github.com/gionkunz/chartist-js/blob/develop/site/data/pages/examples.yml" target="_blank">pull request
                  for this page</a> and add your plugin to the list.

                        The point label plugin can be used if you like to add simple labels on top of your data points
                        on line charts. This is usefull if you'd like the user to see the exact values of the data without
                        any additional interaction.

                        The sketchy plugin makes your charts look like they have been drawn by hand. This plugin makes use
                        of SVG filters and works on IE10+, Safari 7+ and Android 4.4+. Also note that SVG filters are not
                        very performant and they will eat your users mobile battery quickly for sure.

                  Plugins are functions that will be called for each chart that is created with the plugin enabled
                  (specified in the <code>plugins</code> configuration of a chart). The plugin function will be called with one
                  argument which is the chart that is registering itself for the plugin. If you wish to use some additional
                  parameters or configuration for your plugin initialization, it's recommended to use a function factory.
                  You can check the example plugin for an implementation using a function factory.

                  From the chart object <code>options</code>, <code>svg</code> (root SVG element) and the
                  <code>eventEmitter</code> can be used to manipulate the behaviour of the chart. It's the
                  responsibility of the plugin to decide if it should be activated on a given chart (i.e. by checking
                  the chart type <code>chart instanceof Chartist.Line</code> etc.).

                  It's recommended to use the events of Chartist.js (like <code>draw</code>) to manipulate the
                  underlying elements. Using the events, plugins can chain up in a natural way and work independently
                   on extending the functionality of the chart.

      - type: text
        data:
          text: >
                  Plugins should contain their own default settings and use <code>Chartist.extend</code> to override
                  the settings specified in the options passed to the plugin factory function. Using
                  the <code>optionsProvider</code> of the chart object one could also implement functioanlity based on
                  the chart configuration as well as responsive configuration.
